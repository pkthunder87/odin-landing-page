Odin Project: Landing Page

For this project I am creating a landing webpage from scratch. I will
have to use my knowledge of GitHub, HTML, CSS, and Flex Box to create a
webpage layout from a provided design image and list of properties. This
might mimic a small part of a real life client's requests for an actual
website so it is a valuable experience.
